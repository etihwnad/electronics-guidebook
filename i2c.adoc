== Introduction

I2C, or sometimes called TWI (Two Wire Interface), is a common serial communication standard which uses three wires to communicate between 2 or more devices.
Slave devices listen until the first byte of the transmission (address) matches their own address.
All devices on the bus are _open-drain_, meaning they can only pull the bus low.
Pull-up resistors are needed to ensure the idle or "`1`" state is at the power supply voltage.
The Master device initiates a transaction and sends the clock signal (SCL).
The slave device with the matching address pulls the SDA bus low to indicate a "`0`" and leaves the SDA bus high for a "`1`".
Sometimes, a slave can hold the SCL bus low (called _clock-stretching_) to ask the Master to wait until a data bit is ready.

Every device connects to the same node, making a wired-OR connection for low values: the bus is low when ANY device pulls the node low.


.but isn't I^2^C called a "`two-wire bus`" -- why three wires?

Communicating between devices with different power supplies presents a problem:

To which voltage should the SCL/SDA lines be pulled when idle?

* Pulling up to the *higher* voltage may damage the device using the lower power supply voltage.

* Pulling up to the *lower* voltage may not be high enough to be correctly sensed as a logic "1" for the higher voltage devices

This makes for an interesting problem because of the open-drain nature of the bus.

Any device must be able to pull the bus node to 0V to indicate a logic "0".

When idle or logic "1" the bus should be pulled up to each device's own power supply voltage.


It is possible to do this with a single N-type MOSFET per bus line (SDA and SCL).

â†’ For the figure below, find the voltages at the two SDA nodes and the operation mode of the NFET when NO devices are driving their bus segment low.
