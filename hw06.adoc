== Reading
Read <<AoE>> section _2.3.8 Differential amplifiers_ starting on page 103.

We will analyze and build several ciruits using differential pairs, ending with a *complete operational amplifier* (!).
That circuit will provide a nice bridge to our next course unit about designing with real-world opamps.
We will also begin to make heavy use of the Analog Discovery 2's advanced features for plotting _real-time_ frequency responses (a.k.a. Bode plots).



== Handout analysis

Analyze the common emitter circuit from Monday's handout.  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Jnz7tVqaOAhn6Fm6txUvS1EjB318w53v[2018-09-19 handout^]

* This document (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VKrrSRtp2Rr2xaJygbBOaLBeu34VTzGE[amplifier-terms_CE.pdf^]) is a _much_ better version of what I wrote on the handout in class.
The only difference is that I include the full Z~E~ instead of it being bypassed in the handout with the BFC C~E~.
It is also posted in the *Class notes G-Drive folder*.

Do this analysis using the *full circuit analysis and algebra* twice, first using the *hybrid pi* model and then using the *T model*.
Reference <<bjt-amplifiers.adoc#_small_signal_models,Guidebook: &sect; Small-signal models>>.

For each circuit, find the following small-signal quantities:

* [ ] Amplifier input resistance stem:[R_{in}].
* [ ] Amplifier output resistance stem:[R_{out}].
* [ ] Amplifier open-circuit voltage gain stem:[\left(A_{v0}=\dfrac{v_{out}}{v_{in}}\bigg\rvert_{R_L \rightarrow \infty}\right)].  This is *without* R~load~ connected.
* [ ] Amplifier loaded voltage gain stem:[\left(A_v=\dfrac{v_{out}}{v_{in}}\right)].  This is *with* R~load~ connected.  This should be easy if you think of Th&eacute;venin equivalents.

If you do not get the exact same symbolic results: you are not finished, keep going!
For a fun(?) third round, try using the <<bjt-amplifiers.adoc#bjt-amplifiers,Table 6: BJT amplifier types>> table and get the same answers.

**Re-write your solutions into the following format:**footnote:[I will hand your paper back without grading for you to actually re-write!]

* One side of writing per page.
* One column of intermixed schematic, math, and text.
* Near-zero cross-outs or erase marks.
