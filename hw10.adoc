Find the numerical values of the small-signal parameters G~m1~, R~1~, G~m2~, and R~2~ shown in <<model>> that correspond to your discrete opamp of <<opamp>>.

Draw the small-signal model of the schematic.

* The third stage, the emitter-follower is removed from the small-signal model.
* The output of the model stem:[v_o] and node `D6` corresponds to node number `4` in the schematic.
* For the purposes of this analysis, make set the value of schematic resistor `R2` to zero.
* Since this is a differential input situation, use the "`differential mode half-circuit`" technique to deal with the input differential pair.  Node `3` will therefore be grounded.
* It is easy to find the G~m~'s if you find the short-circuit current thru a wire from node `2` to `GND` or node `4` to `GND`.

To get a start on the next homework, build both the transistor-level schematic and the small-signal model in LTspice.  Monday will have a few techniques for simulating the open-loop parameters of opamps.

As always, ask questions over the https://valpo-engr.slack.com/messages/C041AGR5K/[Slack #electronics channel].

**Hand in your work on ENGINEERING PAPER:**footnote:[I will hand your paper back without grading for you to actually re-write!]

* One side of writing per page.
* One column of intermixed schematic, math, and text.
* Near-zero cross-outs or erase marks.  (you have plenty of paper!)footnote:[See Prof. White if you didn't receive your _complementary_ pad of engineering paper.]
