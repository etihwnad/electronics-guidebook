This chapter discusses the fundamentals of amplifiers and how we analyze and
talk about them.
These concepts apply to _all_ amplifiers regardless of how they are constructed
internally.

What makes this way of thinking about amplifiers so powerful is we can separate
how the the amplifier is _used_ in a larger system from how it is _constructed_
internally.
At any given time, a person is only concerned about one of these aspects and
can therefore effectively _not care_ about the other.


== Pre-requisites

We start with amplifiers which behave the same at all frequencies.
This means that we are ignoring capacitors, inductors, and any
frequency-dependence of devices such as transistors.

<<LEC>> has a well-written tour of this material in https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/[Lessons in Electric Circuits: Volume 1 - Direct Current^], Chapters 1 through 10.

Most important to this discussion are the wonderful tools of Th√©venin (mostly) and Norton (some) equivalent circuits.
You can find more discussion and worked examples at <<CL-book>>'s section https://www.circuitlab.com/textbook/thevenin-equivalent-and-norton-equivalent-circuits/[Thevenin Equivalent and Norton Equivalent Circuits^].
