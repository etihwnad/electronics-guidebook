This chapter discusses the fundamentals of amplifiers and how we analyze and
talk about them.
These concepts apply to _all_ amplifiers regardless of how they are constructed
internally.

What makes this way of thinking about amplifiers so powerful is we can separate
how the the amplifier is _used_ in a larger system from how it is _constructed_
internally.
At any given time, a person is only concerned about one of these aspects and
can therefore effectively _not care_ about the other.


== Pre-requisites

We start with amplifiers which behave the same at all frequencies.
This means that we are ignoring capacitors, inductors, and any
frequency-dependence of devices such as transistors.

<<LEC>> has a well-written tour of this material in https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/direct-current/[Lessons in Electric Circuits: Volume 1 - Direct Current^], Chapters 1 through 10.

Most important to this discussion are the wonderful tools of Th√©venin (mostly) and Norton (some) equivalent circuits.
You can find more discussion and worked examples at <<CL-book>>'s section https://www.circuitlab.com/textbook/thevenin-equivalent-and-norton-equivalent-circuits/[Thevenin Equivalent and Norton Equivalent Circuits^].

* Analysis of circuits containing:
** Ideal independent and dependent sources: *VCVS*, *VCCS*, CCVS, CCCS.
** Resistors, capacitors, inductors.
* Analysis techniques:
** Equivalent circuts:
*** Thevenin / Norton
* DC circuit analysis basics.
* AC circuits




== lower UPPER signal notation

.Symbol notation for signal quantities
[#t-signal-notation]
[cols="^.^2,^.^1,7"]
|===
|Capitalization |Example |Meaning

|lower~UPPER~
|stem:[v_{BE}]
|total quantity, as measured by an oscilloscope with DC coupling

|UPPER~UPPER~
|stem:[V_{BE}]
|DC value (average)

|lower~lower~
|stem:[v_{be}]
|signal quantity, changes

|UPPER~lower~
|stem:[V_{be}]
|complex-valued phasor

|lower~UPPER~ = UPPER~UPPER~ +&nbsp;lower~lower~
|stem:[v_{BE} = V_{BE} + v_{be}]
|total signal is average + changes
|===




== Small-signal equivalent circuits

* Set all independent DC sources to zero.
** V-sources &rarr; short-circuit
** I-sources &rarr; open-circuit
** Keep inductors and capacitors as-is unless they are _functional_ *BFL* or **BFC**s.footnote:[foasf]

* Re-draw the circuit.
