The ECE department has the following passive parts::
* All E12 resistor values from 1&nbsp;&ohm; to 10&nbsp;M&ohm; with 5% tolerance.
* All E6 capacitor values from 100&nbsp;pF to 100&nbsp;&mu;F in overlapping types.
* E3 capacitor values from 10&nbsp;pF&mdash;100&nbsp;&mu;F and 100&nbsp;&mu;F&mdash;1000&nbsp;&mu;F.
